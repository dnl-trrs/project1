    <h1>Some things about me</h1><img src="img/banner.png" alt="channel banner">
    <ul>
        <p>I'm a musician</p>
        <li>guitar</li>
        <li>drums</li>
        <p>I'm a "YouTuber"</p>
        <li>I've been making videos since 2016</li>
        <li>I'm looking into streaming again</li>
        <li>Most of my videos are related to things I work on in my personal time and I share it to my channel, its a bit of a diary</li>
        <p>If I didn't major in ITM, I would've majored in Audio Engineering or looked into Community College, Certifications, and maybe some form of religious studies.</p>
        <li>Audio Engineering was something I was interested in as a creative person musically and visually but I've always been strong in the technical aspects of things relating to the technology used for creative work.</li>
        <li>I wasn't going to apply to college and just go straight to community college but after doing FAFSA and doing early applications to a handful of school I was offered enough money that I'd be a fool to pass on it.</li>
